# Notes

## Data - cleaning:

+ delivery_date
+ user_dob
+ reduce colors
    * drop esoteric colors by colorconverter.json
    * summarize seldom colors to "other" category

## Feature - engineering:

USERS:
+ days until delivery # Done
+ days between order and registration: user_tenure # Done
+ number of previous orders # Done
+ avg. orders per month # Done
+ avg. item price per order # Done
+ total money ordered (not necessarily spent) until current order # Done
+ avg order size: i.e. num_items / num_orders # Done
+ total order size on this day # Done
+ provided day of birth
+ fit decision tree to age variable  # maybe later?
+ cluster users based on their avg orders/avg basket size

ITEMS:
+ WOE on:
    * brand_id, 
    * item_size, 
    * item_id

TIME:
+ seasonal dummies: 
    + christmas season

    HOWEVER... all these dummies suck!
    People seem to adjust for seasonal changes, i.e. from winter to spring, from spring to autumn, from autumn to winter...

In particular, we observe spikes in JULY,SEPTEMBER, JANUARY, MARCH

## Algorithms:
    
+ Logistic Regression (with and without Regularization)
+ Naive Bayes
+ Random Forest
+ Gradient Boosted Trees
    
+ Genetic Algorithm

## Grading:
    + build multiple models
    + and compare them
