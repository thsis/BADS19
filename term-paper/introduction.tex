During online purchases customers often send back items they order. These returns are costly and because of the high competition in online retail it is not possible or highly inadvisible to pass on the costs of return shipping to the customer. Therefore, accurate predictions of product returns could allow online retailers to impede problematic transactions, for example by restricting payment options or by displaying a warning message and thus cut down on cost due to shipping. 

Section \ref{eda} contains a description of the data and the exploratory results results. Section \ref{preparation} describes the actions taken in order to clean the data and a brief overview of the efforts taken during feature engineering. Section \ref{tuning} specifies the different algorithms that were deployed and section \ref{evaluation} includes a succinct discussion of the results. Section \ref{special} tries to minimize the costs of misclassifying an item directly by using a custom built and modified Genetic Algorithm. Finally, section \ref{conclusion} contains concluding remarks.
