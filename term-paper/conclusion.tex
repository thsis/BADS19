For large online retailers, who are confronted with a large number of orders even a small reduction in the average cost per item can have a sizeable effect on the generated profit. This means that even miniscule improvements in the cost structure of an online retailer can ensure its long term profitability in a highly competitive field.

This analysis shows that it is possible to not only mitigate the costs by either providing a good enough classic machine learning model that provides satisfactory probability estimates in terms of the Receiver Operating Characteristic or by minimizing the costs of misclassification directly with non-gradient based methods such as the Genetic Algorithm. But that the standard Logistic Regression in conjecture with a Genetic Algorithm also can lead to substantial efficiency gains when applied correctly.
