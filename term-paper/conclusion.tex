The reduction in cost compared to the baseline has been negligible at best, most of the runs returned a result that led to a worse cost than always predicting a return. It seems that throwing semi-random coefficients at a Logit model is not a suitable way of minimizing a cost function, especially if a Random Forest, that was not trained with this specific task leads to more favorable costs in the test set.
